The data are distributed<br>
Eech part of the data, first go through map phase<br>
Like map documents to words<br><br>

Then those words shuffle to different node<br>
And go to reduce phase<br>
Like count how many words<br><br>

Most tricky thing is how to make it high available<br>
Map Reduce's solution is to store each steps' result TO DISK<br>

HDFS and Map Reduce is the corner stone of Big Data Solution<br><br>

Just linux, there are different distributions<br>
